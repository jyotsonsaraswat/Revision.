            "Hey there, it's me, <strong>Luffy</strong>! I wanted to take a moment to talk about my brother <strong>Ace</strong>. It still hurts to think about him being gone, and I want you to know that I'm really sorry he had to die. <strong>Ace</strong> was such an amazing person and an incredible pirate. He had a big heart and always stood up for what he believed in. Losing him was one of the hardest things I've ever gone through.
        </p>
        <p>
        But even though he's gone, I know that <strong>Ace</strong> would want us to keep on living and fighting for our dreams. He wouldn't want us to give up or lose hope. So let's keep pushing forward, just like <strong>Ace</strong> did. Let's keep striving to become the strongest pirates out there, and let's do it in his memory.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Ace</strong>, I miss you so much, but I promise to keep living for the both of us. Rest in peace, brother."

            "Hello there! It's me, <strong>Rock Lee</strong> I wanted to take a moment to talk about my dear friend and teammate, <strong>Neji</strong>. His passing was a great loss to us all, and my heart goes out to his loved ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Neji</strong> was an incredibly skilled and powerful ninja, and he inspired me to become stronger. His devotion to his duties and his teammates was unwavering, and I admired him greatly. His death has left a hole in our hearts, and we will miss him dearly.
        </p>
        <p>
            But I know that <strong>Neji</strong> would want us to keep moving forward and to never give up. He believed in hard work and perseverance, and those are values that we should all strive to embody. Let us honor his memory by continuing to train hard and to always fight for what is right.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Neji</strong>, my friend, I will always cherish the time we spent together. You will always be remembered as a hero and a true shinobi. Rest in peace, my friend."
